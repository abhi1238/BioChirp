Ensures comprehensive insights by mapping drugs, targets, and diseases seamlessly.

**Intelligent Query Mapping**

Accurately maps user queries to corresponding database fields using advanced language models, supporting fields such as drug names, disease names, target names, gene names, pathways, biomarkers, mechanisms of action, and approval statuses.

**Precision and Semantic Search**

Handles both exact matches and semantic matches (e.g., "TB" maps to "Tuberculosis") for biological terms.
Reduces errors and improves query relevance.

**Efficient Data Retrieval**

Retrieves only relevant rows from the database based on query intent.
Enables downloading filtered data as CSV files for further analysis.

**Contextual Insights**

Generates concise, observation-based summaries for query results using GPT-4o-mini.
